## XPollinate

XPollinate is a cross-chain bridge that allows users to connect their Web3 wallets and swap assets between different networks, such as xDai Chain, Matic Mainnet, Fantom Mainnet and Binance Smart Chain Mainnet.

## Project Structure

The default template is a monorepo created with [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

Workspaces makes it possible to setup multiple packages in such a way that we only need to run `yarn install` once to install all of them in
a single pass. Dependencies are hoisted at the root.

Owing to this dependency on Yarn Workspaces, Create Eth App can't be used with npm.

## Available Scripts
